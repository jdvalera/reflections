When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I want to access my work in multiple areas with multiple devices. It is also backed up remotely just in case anything happens to my local repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to update any changes made from your remote repository to your local repository.
